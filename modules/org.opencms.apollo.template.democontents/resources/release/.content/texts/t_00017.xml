<h3>Backward compatibility</h3>
<p>OpenCms 10.0.0 Alpha 2&nbsp;is fully backward compatible with all 9.x versions. Templates and other OpenCms developed code from these versions should work "out of the box" with version 10.0.0 Alpha 2.</p>
<p><span class="label label-danger">Notice for users of Alkacon OCEE</span>&nbsp;OpenCms&nbsp;10.0.0 Alpha 2 will not work with current versions of Alkacon OCEE. There will be an updated OCEE available for the final release of OpenCms 10. The&nbsp;update will be free for Alkacon customers with a valid OCEE update subscription.</p>
<h3>Compatibility with Java versions, servlet containers and databases</h3>
<p>OpenCms&nbsp;10.0.0 Alpha 2 has been written and tested for Java 8&nbsp;and Java 7. We have tested with ORACLEs JDK as well as OpenJDK. OpenCms should run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms works "out of the box" with Tomcat 8, which we recommend. Others have reported deploying OpenCms successfully on other servlet containers like JBoss, BEA, Websphere, Glassfish and Resin Professional.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, DB2 and HSQLDB.</p>
